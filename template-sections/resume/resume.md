# Resume

> I am a computer scientist and a software engineer. I have experience in programming, algorithms, data structures, complexity and optimisation. I also have good knowledge of computer, software architecture and operating systems. I always strive to learn more, find new and better ways to get the things done, being perfectionist when it counts. What I love the most is simplicity, transform tough problems into a simple and elegant solution.
